    about_me: After completing programming courses and internships at two companies, I secured a permanent Software Engineer role in the second one, working primarily with PHP technologies. I later transitioned to Python/Django and led two internal hackathon projects in the past two years. I also gained experience with Docker, CI tools, testing frameworks and mentored colleagues and students in Python/Django and React. I also took on a Development Lead role, managing six colleagues' career progression.
