    description: During this period, I began my journey as a Software Engineer, where I initially worked extensively with PHP technologies, including Drupal, WordPress, and Symfony. After the first one and a half years, I transitioned to working on Python/Django and Next.js projects, a focus that spanned over four years. In addition to my development work, I took on leadership roles in two internal hackathon projects and mentored colleagues and students in Python/Django and React. I also gained valuable experience with Docker and various CI tools. For the last three years of this period, I exclusively worked on Ubuntu, solidifying my proficiency with this operating system.
