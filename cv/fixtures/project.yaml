    description:
      I recently architected and developed a Next.js app designed for online parking payments.
      Leveraging the flexibility of a monorepo on GitHub, I integrated a Cypress project to
      rigorously test the Next.js application, ensuring robust and reliable performance. This
      web application implemented in Next.js is a short-term, ad-hoc parking solution that allows
      unknown parkers to pay on-site for their parking transaction. The application is designed to
      streamline the parking process, making it as simple and seamless as possible for the user.
