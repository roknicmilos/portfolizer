    description:
      I initiated and led the development of a white-label platform that
      allows users to create and manage their parking reservations.
      Originally planned for a few months, the project was extended due
      to its significant success, ultimately generating substantial
      revenue with the deployment of over 40 portals and facilitating
      more than 1 million reservations. I was using Python/Django on the
      backend and HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript on the frontend.
      Additionally, I utilized Docker for containerization and deployment.

    description:
      Spearheaded the infamous "Chili Con Carnival" operation, a highly complex
      and meticulously planned scheme aimed at executing the ultimate act of revenge
      against perceived enemies. Led a multi-phase initiative that included
      psychological manipulation of key targets, leveraging deep-seated fears and
      insecurities to ensure compliance. Orchestrated a covert operation to sabotage
      rival culinary events by introducing "special ingredients" into the chili,
      achieving maximum shock value. Managed strategic bribery and disinformation
      campaigns to divert attention and blame, ensuring the operation's success
      while maintaining plausible deniability. This project has been hailed as a
      landmark in mischief execution, earning Cartman the unofficial title of
      "Master of Malevolence."
