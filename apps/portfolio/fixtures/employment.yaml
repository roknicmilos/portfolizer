    description:
      During this period, I began my journey as a Software Engineer,
      where I initially worked extensively with PHP technologies,
      including Drupal, WordPress, and Symfony. After the first one
      and a half years, I transitioned to working on Python/Django
      and Next.js projects, a focus that spanned over four years.
      In addition to my development work, I took on leadership roles
      in two internal hackathon projects and mentored colleagues and
      students in Python/Django and React. I also gained valuable
      experience with Docker and various CI tools. For the last three
      years of this period, I exclusively worked on Ubuntu, solidifying
      my proficiency with this operating system.
